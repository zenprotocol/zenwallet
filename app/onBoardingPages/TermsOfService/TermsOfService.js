            <ul>
              <li>
                <span >Section 1.01 Authorized Protocol​.</span> The Authorized Protocol is the set of rules and processes by which blocks
                are added to the Community Release Blockchain in a manner that the Community Release does, always linked to the Genesis Block.
                The Authorized Protocol includes the version of the Licensed Software that accepts those blocks and transactions that the
                Community Release accepts and rejects those blocks and transactions which the Community Release rejects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span >Section 1.02 Community Release​.</span> The Community Release is ​the later of (i) the first protocol client compiled
                from the code with git commit/tag identifier [37ce6b3f626137b09147849b146716fbf5ad4872] released on June 30, 2018
                (also known as “​Malkuth​”), and (ii) any subsequent version of code that is approved by Community Vote.
                The Community Release shall always tie back to the Genesis Block.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span> Section 1.03 Genesis Block​. </span> The double SHA-3 Hash of the Genesis Block that initiates the Community Release
                Blockchain (the block with block number 1 accepted by the Community Release), dated June 30th, 2018, is attached in ​Appendix A​ below.

                (i.e., those Zen Tokens that have been issued on the Community Release Blockchain) is 20% of the total number of Zen Tokens to be issued.
                Generally, additional Zen Tokens shall be generated according to the following approximate sexennial schedule:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li> Over the six years following the Community Release Date, 40% of the total number of Zen Tokens to be issued shall be issued; </li>
                  <li> Over the following six years, an additional 20% of the total number of Zen Tokens to be issued shall be issued; </li>
                  <li> Over the third sexennial period, an additional 10% of the total number of Zen Tokens to be issued shall be issued; </li>
                  <li> For each successive sexennial period thereafter, half as great a percentage as was applied in the preceding period shall be applied. </li>

                <span >Section 2.01 Community​.</span> Miners neither govern nor determine the overall development of the project. Rather,
                the rules are made by the community of Zen Token holders. To this end, Article II provides rules for decentralized governance
                in using the Licensed Software. The following principles underpin this document:
                <ol type="a">
                  <li> Decisions shall not be determined on the basis of ‘one CPU one vote’ or any other hashpower mechanism. </li>
                  <li> Decisions shall not be made by possession or control of any single code repository. </li>
                  <li> Decisions shall not be made by hard forks or soft forks. </li>
                  <li> Decisions shall not be made by blackmail, rants on social media, intimidation or any other coercive means.</li>
                  <li> Rather, decisions shall be made by a vote of tokens.</li>

              <li>
                <span >Section 2.02 Changes to the Authorized Protocol​.</span> At any time, an affirmative majority vote (50% plus one Zen Token)
                of the total number of Zen Tokens that have been issued on the Community Release Blockchain (such issued total, the “​Existing Tokens​”)
                can authorize a change to the Authorized Protocol. Each Zen Token entitles the owner to one vote. For the avoidance of doubt,
                Zen Tokens that have not yet been generated are not included in calculating the total of Existing Tokens. In addition, a change to
                the Authorized Protocol is not necessarily a change to the underlying Licensed Software. Prior to being voted on for adoption,
                any proposed change to the Authorized Protocol must first be determined to be eligible for such a vote in the first place.
                The procedure for this is set forth in Section 2.03(c). Votes are tallied in accordance with the procedures described in Section 2.04(d).
                The following is a non-exhaustive list of items that require a majority vote (50% plus one Zen Token) of Existing Tokens:
                <ol type="i">
                  <li> a change of the number of proposals that can be adopted per scheduled six month Community Vote. Currently, all eligible
                    proposals are voted on, but only one proposal will be adopted, regardless of differences in the types of changes each proposal
                    puts forth. Votes are consolidated into a single vote. ​For example​: proposals for a change in block size and a change in
                    the mining algorithm, are all considered and voted on against one another in zero-sum fashion; only one proposal will be adopted);
                  </li>
                  <li> a change of the requirement that all new Community Release code to have a hard stop to be a valid candidate for a vote (Section 2.03(c)(iii); </li>
                  <li> a change of maximum 100 million total supply of Zen Tokens to be generated (Section 1.04); </li>
                  <li> a change of Zen Token supply curve (Section 1.04);</li>
                  <li> a change of the genesis block necessary for the authorized protocol; or</li>
                  <li> a change to the voting threshold requirements.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  <span>Changes to Community Release​.</span> If a majority (50% of Tokens voted plus one Zen Token) of votes cast (but not necessarily a majority
                  of Existing Tokens) support a new Community Release, such version shall be the next version of the Community Release (as of the date determined
                  in the Community Vote); provided, however, that such new Community Release does not contravene the Authorized Protocol. A change to the Community
                  Release that contravenes the Authorized Protocol is considered a breach of the Software License, automatically terminates your right to
                  use the Software License Software and may be considered copyright infringement. For the sake of clarity, in order to effect a change to the
                  Community Release that would require a change to the Authorized Protocol (i.e. because such new Community Release contravenes the Authorized Protocol
                  in place at the time), the voting requirements in Section 2.02 must first be followed to authorize the necessary change to the Authorized Protocol.
                  That is, in advance of the scheduled semiannual Community Vote, the user can initiate an unscheduled vote on a proposal to change the Authorized Protocol
                  pursuant to Section 2.02. Prior to being voted on for adoption, any proposed changes to the Authorized Protocol must first be determined to
                  be eligible for such a vote, as set forth in Section 2.03(c). Votes are tallied in accordance with the procedures described in Section 2.04(d).

                <li>
                  <span>No Majority </span> If no Community Release proposal is approved by a majority of votes cast in a Community Vote, a “runoff” Community Vote
                  shall occur, in which the two proposals that received the highest number of affirmative votes cast in the original Community Vote shall be voted on.
                  If a majority (50% of Tokens voted plus one Zen Token) of votes cast in the runoff support a new Community Release proposal, such version shall be
                  the next version of the Community Release (as of the date determined in the Community Vote).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Community Release Proposal Requirements​ </span> In order to be eligible for a vote, a proposal for a new Community Release must:
                  <ol type="i">
                    <li>
                      be on an actual implementation with publicly available code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      have a blockchain which accepts the initial Genesis Block and the blocks later derived from it based on the ‘legitimate’ technical
                      consensus mechanism as agreed on in the previous vote (i.e., the longest chain). ​For example​: in the period of time between the
                      Genesis Block and the first Community Vote the legitimate mechanism is SHA-3 proof-of-work. If there is a change in proof-of-work
                      based on the vote that occurs in 6 months (EG to SHA-256) than between interval 1 and interval 2 the legitimate mechanism is Sha 256.
                      Therefore the Authorised protocol at the end of 1 year should contain roughly 64,800 blocks of SHA-256 preceded by 64,800 blocks of
                      SHA-3 that terminate/originate with genesis block X;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      implement a stop every 7 months blocks. Malkuth (version one of the Community Release) has a stop after 7 months. Version two is
                      elected by the community, but must include a hard stop 7 months later, unless a majority of 50% plus one Zen Token of Existing
                      Tokens votes otherwise;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      include a readme document in the ‘git commit’ (see Section 2.05) explaining the changes in the proposed version of the Community Release.
                      The description of the updates must discuss the material changes and differences, as well as the people responsible for developing
                      and implementing the proposed version.
                    </li>

                <li>
                  <span>Determining Proposals Eligible for a Vote​.</span> In both the scheduled semiannual Community Votes and the unscheduled votes,
                  in order for a proposed Community Release version and/or potential upgrade to the Authorized Protocol to be eligible for a Community Vote,
                  such proposals must first be approved by a vote of 3% of ​the total Existing Tokens. Such proposals must be submitted by sending a message
                  signed with a public key associated with a Zen balance to Authorized Nodes by initiating a transaction to the voting smart contract.
                  The transaction message shall include a smart contract with Zen Tokens information clearly indicating the proposal that you wish to be
                  voted on, in the form of plain text or a hash of the git commit and URL of the repository. As mentioned in 2.03(c)(iv), in the case of
                  Community Release proposals, the message must include a readme document describing the changes and team responsible. Messages that do
                  not reasonably communicate a clear voting preference shall not be counted. If a proposal did not obtain the aforementioned vote of approval
                  3% of Existing Tokens, any vote on such ineligible proposal in a Community Vote shall be ignored, and the user will not be able to vote on
                  another proposal during such Community Vote. Proposals relating to votes to change the Authorized outside of the semiannual Community Vote must first be
                  determined to be eligible for a vote as set forth in this Section 2.03(c) no less than 30 days prior to the actual Section 2.02 vote.
                  Votes are tallied in accordance with the procedures described in Section 2.04(d).
                </li>
                <li>
                  No Proposals​. If no upgrades to the Community Release are proposed for a given Community Vote Date, a “default upgrade” will occur in which
                  the block version number is incremented by one, the stop date is increased by 7 months, and nothing else changes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No Quorum Requirement​. For the avoidance of doubt, no quorum (whether of Tokens or Token holders) shall be required for a Community Vote.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <li>
                <span>Section 2.04 Mechanism for Proposal Submission and Voting​.</span> Users control the development of the Licensed Software by voting on both the
                technical changes, and the people responsible for implementing and maintaining those changes. Using the Authorized Node software, users can submit a
                proposal to be voted on by sending a message signed with a public key associated with a Zen balance to Authorized Nodes by initiating a transaction to
                the voting smart contract. Similarly, using the Authorized Node software, users can vote on a proposal by sending a message signed with a public key associated
                with a Zen balance to Authorized Nodes by initiating a transaction to the voting smart contract. The transaction message shall include a smart contract with
                information clearly and unambiguously indicating your vote or the proposal that you wish to be voted on, as the case may be, in the form of plain text or a hash
                of git commit and URL of the repository being voted on or proposed to be voted on pursuant to 2.03(d). As mentioned in 2.03(c)(iv), in the case of Community Release
                proposals, the message must include a readme document describing the changes and team responsible
                <span className="bold"> Messages that do not reasonably communicate a clear voting preference shall not be counted​.</span>
                <ol type="a">
                  <li> <span>One Vote per Period​. </span> All eligible proposals are voted on, but only one proposal will be adopted, regardless of differences in the types of changes each
                    proposal puts forth. Votes are consolidated into a single vote. For example: proposals for changes in block size, hashing algorithm, reward size are all
                    considered and voted on against one another in zero-sum fashion; only one proposal will be adopted.

                      <li>
                        Votes shall occur every six months, beginning with six months from the Malkuth release date.

                      <li>
                        In weeks 19-20, the community shall vote on those Community Release proposals that received more than 3% or more in the Section 2.03(d) eligibility voting.

                      <li>
                        In the event that no Community Release Proposal received an affirmative majority of votes, the community shall conduct a runoff vote in weeks 23-24.

                    their tallies by broadcasting such information to the Authorized Nodes in the form of a transaction message. Tokens may not be voted more than once. Messages that
                    do not reasonably communicate a clear voting preference shall not be counted.
