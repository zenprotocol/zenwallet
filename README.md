# Install/Update Wallet

## Step 1: Installation

Run the following commands in the Terminal / Command Prompt:
```
npm config set @zen:registry https://www.myget.org/F/zenprotocol/npm/
npm install @zen/zen-wallet -g
```

## Step 2: Updating

Run the command:
```
npm install @zen/zen-wallet -g
```

## Step 3: Running wallet and full node

Run `zen-wallet` from anywhere in your command line (terminal) to start  up the wallet

## Running with arguments

### Wipe (Clear Data)
When we launch a new testnet sometimes you will need to wipe your local database in order to sync. Note that this will delete any data/tokens from the wallet.

You can do this by running: `zen-wallet wipe`

### Miner
In order to run a node with a miner run the wallet with the `miner` argument like this: `zen-wallet miner`
*Running with miner allows you to get the block reward of Zen Tokens every time a new block is mined.

### Headless
1. Install the node (without GUI) by running the command `npm install @zen/zen-node -g`
2. Type the command `zen-node`
